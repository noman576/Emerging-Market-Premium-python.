# Emerging-Market-Premium-python.
Emerging markets are an interesting research topic in academic literature. The emerging market is defined as the market of an emerging country – a country between a developing and a developed country. Since the early 2000s, emerging markets have become a popular investment area and several new funds and tools for investing in those countries have been introduced. In a financial view, emerging markets tend to have higher risk, e.g. higher volatility in the stock markets and political risks but they are often related to higher growth and higher returns. In many financial fields like asset pricing and corporate finance, the concept of Equity Risk Premium (ERP) is widely used. The ERP is defined as the difference between the return of a risky equity investment (e.g. into stocks) and the risk-free interest rate (e.g. government bonds). Because of the higher risk in emerging markets, the ERP for emerging markets – the emerging market premium – shall be higher than in developed countries. This study will examine the existence of the emerging market premium by determining the minimum variance portfolio and the portfolio with the maximum Sharpe-ratio for emerging markets on the one hand and for developed countries on the other hand.

To verify the existence of an emerging market premium, this study focuses on stock indices of developed and emerging countries. To get a well-diversified portfolio, the stock indices to analyze were selected around the world. For the developed countries, indices from the big markets in North America (Dow Jones), Europe (EuroStoxx50) and Asia-Pacific (Nikkei225) were chosen. The stock indices of the emerging markets only contain stocks from the BRICS-States (Brazil, Russia, India, China & South Africa). Besides, a differentiation between small-cap, mid-cap and large-cap indices was made. The chosen indices are the MSCI BRIC, BRIC Mid Cap and BRIC Small Cap. In order to get valid results, a time series analysis is necessary. In practice, mostly 90 to 180 days are used. In this study the analyzed period contains the year 2019 (2018-12-31 – 2019-12-31). In addition, in a second analysis, the analyzed period is extended until June 2020. This management summary is created in spring 2020 in the middle of the omnipresent Covid-19 pandemic and the global stock markets had some huge crashes in the last months so it could be interesting to take a look on possible differences between emerging and developed countries.

With the help of the programming language Python, a code was created that calculates and plots the minimum variance portfolio and the portfolio with the maximum sharpe ratio for the developed and the emerging countries, respectively. In addition, the code provides the most important statistics, the weights of the individual indices and the specific returns and volatilities. For running the code, some assumptions must be made. At first, there are no pure BRICS indices so the chosen BRIC indices without South Africa portray the emerging countries. Secondly it was decided to also integrate a „Corona-investigation“ to find possible impacts of the Covid-19-pandemic on different stock markets. After providing a first analysis for the year 2019 with 250 trading days, a second one was created containing 181 trading days from October 1st, 2019 until the mid of June 2020.Thirdly, the risk-free rate is indispensable for determining the Sharpe ratio. Due to the fact that a risk-free rate does not exist naturally, it is common practice to estimate it by yield rates of government bonds. The risk-free rate for this study is calculated by the mean value of 10-year government bonds of the individual countries where the chosen indices come from (ChinaBond, 2020; Deutsche Bundesbank, 2020; FRED St. Louis, 2020b, 2020a; Ministry of Finance Japan, 2020). The mean and not for example a proportion-weighted approach was chosen because the BRIC indices data do not offer information about the weights of stocks from the individual BRIC countries. In addition, the European risk-free rate for the EuroStoxx50 was estimated by German government bonds what is also widely used.

With the help of python, 2500 random portfolios for each of the four investigations are determined. Afterwards, for each of the four cases the weights of the minimum variance portfolio and the portfolio with the maximum sharpe ratio are calculated. In addition, both for the MVP and the maximum Sharpe ratio portfolio, the respective Sharpe ratios are computed.

The findings are partly as expected but also surprising. In the developed markets, the impact of the Covid-19-pandemic could be described as a black swan, reducing the expected return and increasing the volatility. In addition, the market-premium and the Sharpe ratios decline. The emerging markets on the other hand behave against the expectations. In the MVP all, the expected return, the volatility and the market premium lie below the values of the developed markets. The portfolio with the maximum sharpe ratio (SRP) offers a higher return with a higher volatility but the difference is around 1% to the developed markets.

An interesting finding for the developed markets are the nearly identical values for My and Sigma in the MVP and the SRP, respectively. As the figures 1 and 2 will show, the MVP and the SRP do not have a big difference. Furthermore, the Sharpe ratios of the developed markets are also nearly identical both, for 2019 and the „Corona months“. This could be related to the low risk in these countries.On the other hand, the emerging markets show higher differences between the values of My and Sigma and also between the Sharpe ratios Surprising results come from the analysis of the BRICS states while the Covid-19-pandemic. The expected return in the SRP increases to around 23%, the volatility to around 27% and the market premium to around 18%. This could be a proof for the existence for the emerging market premium.

Table 2 shows the weights of the selected indices both, for the MVP and the SRP and for the 2019 and the „Corona“ investigation. For the developed markets, the Dow Jones Index dominates both, the MVP and the SRP, while the EuroStoxx increases its proportion for around 10% from the MVP to the SRP. For the „Corona“ months, its noticeable that the Japanese Nikkei dominates both portfolios. A possible explanation could be that the stock markets did not react in a that negative way like the European and american stock markets did.The weights of the emerging markets differ a lot of those in the developed markets. There are both, much higher and much lower weights in contrast to the developed markets. Especially, for the 2019, the weight of the Small Cap Index in the MVP amounts to around 83% while its weight in the SRP decreases to 0,5% while the Mid Cap Index dominates the SRP with around 96%. However, in the „Corona“ months, the Large Cap Index dominates the MVP with 94% while the Small Cap Index has a weight of 94% in the SRP.

The figures 1-4 show the calculated portfolios in return volatility diagrams. The MVP is shown by a red dot, the portfolio with the maximum Sharpe ratio is highlighted by a blue dot. The visually outstanding result is that the MVP and the SRP are much closer to each other in the developed markets both for the year 2019 and for the „Corona“ months, than in the emerging markets. In those markets, the difference between the MVP and the SRP is quite large. This result was also proven by the numerical results. Finally, this study presented some differences between developed and emerging countries. Based on a market data analysis for two periods of time for two samples of stock indices, the expected market premium of emerging markets couldn’t be confirmed completely. Merely for the last months – the „Corona“ months – an increased market premium for the BRIC states was found. An interesting finding could be the combination of the indices for the portfolios of the emerging markets, because as shown the weights of the small, mid and large cap indices are drifting apart. Overall it can be said that even if some studies prove the emerging market premium, there is no guarantee to find it at every point of time in every chosen market.
